# Reason Media Devices

Hello!
These are basic ReasonML bindings for the MediaDevices WebAPI.
Right now I'm giving preference to the functions I use in [my webRTC app](https://github.com/celsobonutti/elm-webrtc/), 
but I'll try my best to cover the [specification](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaDevices) as much as possible.
